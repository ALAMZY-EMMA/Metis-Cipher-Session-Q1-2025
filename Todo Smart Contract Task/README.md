# To_Do List Smart Contract Project Instructions

Welcome to the To_Do List Smart Contract Project! 

## Instructions
- Write a smart contract to manage a simple to-do list.
- Deploy the to-do list contract on a testnet (i.e., Metis Sepolia).
- Add your deployed smart contract to this README.md
- Create a PR with your solution to this project.

# Deployed Contract Address: <"Your deployed contract address here">


Follow the steps below to contribute your solution to the repository:

### 1. Create Your Folder
Inside this project folder, create a new folder named after your name. Add your solution files (e.g., the smart contract, tests, README for your solution, etc.) into this folder.

```bash
mkdir <your_name>
```

Example:
```bash
mkdir john_todo_project
```

### 2. Add Your Files
Add your solution files to your folder. Make sure your files are well-organized and include necessary documentation or comments explaining your implementation.

### 3. Commit Your Changes
After adding your files, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add TODO List solution for <your_name>"
```

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add TODO List solution for John Doe"
```

### 4. Push To Your Branch
Push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```

Example:
```bash
git push origin john_todo_project
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request
Go to the GitHub repository in your browser. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch. In the PR description, provide a brief overview of your solution and any unique features or considerations.

## Notes
- Ensure your solution compiles and passes all relevant tests before submitting.
- Keep your folder organized and include clear documentation to help others understand your work.
