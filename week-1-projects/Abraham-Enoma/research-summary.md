# Week 1 Tasks - Metis Cipher Session Q1 2025

## Part One - Blockchain Use Cases

Blockchain technology is often believed to be solely about cryptocurrency and trading. However, here are ten real-world examples of how it is already being used beyond digital currencies:

1. **Finance**: Platforms like Ripple revolutionize cross-border payments by enabling fast, low-cost transactions without intermediaries.  
2. **Healthcare**: MediBloc securely stores patient records, ensuring privacy while enabling quick access for authorized users.  
3. **Supply Chain**: IBM Food Trust tracks food origins, ensuring transparency and reducing counterfeiting risks in global supply chains.  
4. **Government**: Blockchain-based voting platforms like Voatz enable tamper-proof, secure digital elections.  
5. **Energy**: Power Ledger facilitates peer-to-peer energy trading, decentralizing the energy market and increasing efficiency.  
6. **Retail**: Starbucks Odyssey uses blockchain to manage loyalty programs, ensuring fraud-proof reward systems.  
7. **Real Estate**: Propy simplifies real estate transactions by using smart contracts, reducing delays and improving security.  
8. **Insurance**: Etherisc automates claims processing, minimizing fraud and ensuring faster payouts.  
9. **Education**: Blockcerts allows secure issuance and verification of academic credentials, fighting certificate fraud.  
10. **Entertainment**: Audius ensures fair royalty distribution to artists, protecting intellectual property rights.

#### Blockchain technology adds value to industries by offering a decentralized, transparent, and secure system, making it an innovative and scalable solution.

## Part Two - Ethereum Blockchain Components 

### To ensure that the standard values created by the blockchain system remain stable, they are built on the following components; 

- **Nodes**: Computers connected to the network, storing and validating transactions.  
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Ethereum uses Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions efficiently.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing programs that automate agreements based on predefined conditions.  
- **Native Token**: Ether (ETH) is used for transactions and to pay gas fees.  
- **Ledger**: Immutable and distributed, ensuring transaction data remains secure and verifiable.  
- **Gas Fees**: Costs associated with computation and data storage on the blockchain.

### To explore Ethereum transactions, I used [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io). Here’s how to track a transaction:
1. Input the transaction hash, wallet address, or token ID into the search bar.  
2. View the transaction details, which include:
   - Sender and recipient wallet addresses.  
   - The amount of Ether transferred.  
   - Transaction status (Success, Pending, or Failed).  
   - Gas fees paid and timestamp.

## Part Three - Highlighting the importance of decentralization and how blockchain technology ensures transparency and security. 

### **1. Importance of Decentralization**
Decentralization is crucial because it removes the need for a central authority, reducing the risk of fraud, censorship, and single points of failure while fostering trust among participants. It ensures: 
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure, making the system more robust.  
- **Censorship Resistance**: Transactions cannot be blocked or altered by central authorities.  
- **Trustless Interactions**: Users don’t need to rely on intermediaries to validate actions.

### **2. Transparency and Security in Blockchain**
Blockchain achieves transparency and security through:
- **Public Ledgers**: All transactions are recorded and viewable by anyone.  
- **Encryption**: Cryptography ensures that transaction data is tamper-proof.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: These secure the network by validating transactions in a decentralized manner.
