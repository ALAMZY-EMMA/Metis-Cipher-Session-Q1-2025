# Week 1 Tasks

Here's my submission for the Metis Cipher Session Q1 2025 Week 1 tasks.

## Part One

### Real-world examples of blockchain usage in different industries
A blockchain is a decentralized ledger storing a growing list of digital records, known as blocks, which are linked together through cryptography. Each block contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction details. This system is shared across many computers, ensuring that no single entity controls the data.
Blockchain core charcteristics include decentralization, transparency, immutability, and automation. This characteristics are applied in different industries creating a plethora of use cases.

**Blockchain in Healthcare**

Blockchain usage in healthcare reduces healthcare costs, improve access to information across stakeholders and streamline business processes. It enables faster, more efficient, and more secure medical data management and medical supply tracking. For healthcare providers, blockchain can also store and credentials, certifications and licences on a distributed ledger, supporting verification processes and mitigating any potential forgeries.
1. [Medicalchain](https://medicalchain.com/en/) uses blockchain to store patient health records securely. This allows patients to control access and share their medical data with healthcare providers.
2. [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/global-pharmaceuticals-company), a pharmaceutical company track drug production and distribution with the help of blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing counterfeit medications.
