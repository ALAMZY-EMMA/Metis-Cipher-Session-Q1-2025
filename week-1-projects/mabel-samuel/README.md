# Week 1 Tasks

Here's my submission for the Metis Cipher Session Q1 2025 Week 1 tasks.

## Part One

### Real-world examples of blockchain usage in different industries
A blockchain is a decentralized ledger storing a growing list of digital records, known as blocks, which are linked together through cryptography. Each block contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction details. This system is shared across many computers, ensuring that no single entity controls the data.
Blockchain core characteristics include decentralization, transparency, immutability, and automation. This characteristics are applied in different industries creating a plethora of use cases.

**Blockchain in Healthcare**

Blockchain usage in healthcare reduces healthcare costs, improve access to information across stakeholders and streamline business processes. It enables faster, more efficient, and more secure medical data management and medical supply tracking. For healthcare providers, blockchain can also store and credentials, certifications and licences on a distributed ledger, supporting verification processes and mitigating any potential forgeries.
1. [Medicalchain](https://medicalchain.com/en/) uses blockchain to store patient health records securely. This allows patients to control access and share their medical data with healthcare providers.
2. [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/global-pharmaceuticals-company), a pharmaceutical company track drug production and distribution with the help of blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing counterfeit medications.
3. [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk-us.com/) is a global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specializing in developing treatments for chronic diseases such as obesity, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. Leveraging advanced technologies like AI and machine learning, the company focuses on protein modeling and innovative therapeutic solutions to address these conditions. It uses blockchain technology in its extensive clinical trials to collect and secure patient data.

**Blockchain in Government**

The unalterable and transparent nature of blockchain can significantly enhance government operations. Blockchain use cases for public operations serve as solutions for secure identity management, transparent voting systems, and efficient public records management, transforming how governments function.

4. [Follow My Vote](https://followmyvote.com/) is a secure online voting platform using an open-source virtual blockchain ballot box. The technology decreases spending on physical ballots and can be accessed via any device. Follow My Vote implements the end-to-end tools that elections need in order to provide total safety and confidence in the voting process.
5. [Voatz](https://voatz.com/) is a mobile voting platform that runs on blockchain. The encrypted biometric security system makes it secure to vote on a mobile device from anywhere in the world without fear of hacking or data corruption. West Virginia is one of the first states to use Voatz to collect votes from eligible service people and travelers abroad during elections.

**Blockchain in Supply Chain and Logistics**

In supply chain and logistics, it amplifies transparency and tracking, ensuring the authenticity of products.

6.  [Maersk](https://www.maersk.com/) provide real-time visibility and data sharing across global logistics with blockchain-based platforms.
7. [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/) is one of the logistics businesses that use blockchain successfully. They implement smart contracts for process automation, ensuring faster deliveries and reduced paperwork.

**Blockchain in Education**

The education sector leverages cutting-edge technologies to securely store academic credentials and improve verification processes.

8.  [The University of Nicosia](https://www.unic.ac.cy/) issues academic certificates on the blockchain, allowing employers or institutions to verify qualifications instantly.

9. [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) uses blockchain to issue tamper-proof diplomas, which allows graduates to share verified credentials with potential employers.

**Blockchain in Media**

Blockchain can address issues like content piracy, intellectual property protection, and royalty distribution in the media industry.

10. [Audius](https://audius.co/), a decentralized music streaming platform, uses distributed ledgers to ensure artists receive fair compensation and royalties directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries.

## Part Two

### Components of a Blockchain

### How to track a transaction on the blockchain

1. **Choose a Blockchain Explorer:** Select a trusted blockchain explorer, such as [etherscan](etherscan.io), to ensure secure and accurate information.
2. **Obtain the TXID or Public Address:** To track a transaction, you’ll need either the TXID(transaction ID) or the public address associated with the transaction. You can also use the block, domain name or token.
3. **Enter the TXID or Address:** Input the TXID or address or block or domain name or token into the blockchain explorer’s search bar, and hit “Enter” to view transaction details.
4. **View Transaction Status and Details:** The explorer will display information about the transaction, including the sending and receiving addresses, confirmation count, and transaction fee.
5. **Monitor the Confirmation Status:** Track the confirmation count to determine when the transaction is fully processed. Generally, six confirmations are the standard for secure transactions.

## Part Three

### Importance of Decentralization in Blockchain

Decentralization in blockchain is the transfer of supervision and decision-making from a centralized association (individual, corporation, or group of people) to a dispersed network. Decentralized networks help in reducing the level of trust participants must place in each other to execute transactions. The most important addition among decentralization benefits is the ability to fight against abuse of power. By placing power in the hands of all stakeholders, decentralization enables a more democratic approach to the use of technology.

### How Blockchain Ensures Transparency and Security
