## Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Welcome to our 3-month training program! In this guide, you'll learn how to contribute your weekly projects to the training repository. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your projects are properly added.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the Metis-Cipher-Session-Q1-2025 repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/Metis-Cipher-Session-Q1-2025.git
cd Metis-Cipher-Session-Q1-2025
```

### 2. Navigate to the Weekly Project Folder
Each week has a designated project folder inside the repository. Navigate to the folder for the current week (e.g., `week-1-projects`, `week-2-projects`):

```bash
cd week-<week_number>-projects
```

Example:
```bash
cd week-1-projects
```

### 3. Create Your Folder
Inside the weekly folder, create a new folder named after your first name or a unique identifier (e.g., `john`, `jane-doe`):

```bash
mkdir <your_name>
```

Example:
```bash
mkdir john
```

### 4. Add Your Project Files
Place all the files related to your project (code, documentation, assets, etc.) into your folder. Ensure your files are organized and well-documented.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Stage and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Week <week_number> project for <your_name>"
```

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add Week 1 project for John Doe"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to the remote repository. If you're on a new branch, use the branch name matching your changes (e.g., `week-1-john-project`):

```bash
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```

Example:
```bash
git push origin week-1-john-project
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
1. Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Create a new pull request from your branch to the main branch.
4. Provide a descriptive title and include details about your project in the description.

Example PR Title:
```
Add Week 1 Project for John Doe
```

### 8. Wait for Review
The repository maintainers will review your pull request. Address any feedback promptly and resubmit if needed.
